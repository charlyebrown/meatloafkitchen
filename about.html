            <h2>About Us: </h2>
            <p> We serve a wholesome, freshly made meal each Saturday – one that
              we are happy to eat ourselves – in a respectful atmosphere to anyone
              who comes through our doors, no questions asked. We provide a
              welcoming place of respite for our guests and offer vital social
              services to those in need. We do this with an all-volunteer staff,
              without a single employee. </p>
            <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
            <p>We've learned that just as good food nourishes the body, respect
              nourishes the soul. Our soup kitchen was one of the first to seat
              and serve its guests with the courtesy one might find at a restaurant,
              as opposed to the traditional food line. Despite our name, we are
              not affiliated with any university nor are we associated with any
              religious organization. Our volunteers come from all walks of life,
              bound together only by our shared desire to lend a helping hand to
              those in need. </p>
            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>University Community Social Services was founded in 1982 by two
              university professors who saw a great need among the many homeless
              people in their neighborhood. Together they started a temporary –
              or so they thought – soup kitchen open to anyone who needed sustenance.
              Over 25 years later, we’re still going strong, and the need is still
              great. Long ago, we figured out that meatloaf is a nourishing comfort
              food that makes a much better meal than soup. We make our meatloaf
              using an original recipe that we have perfected over the years.
              People love it, and we have come over time to be known as “The Meatloaf
              People.” Hunger doesn't take a vacation. Every week since our inception,
              through blackouts, heat waves, blizzards, and even the terrorist 
              attack of 9-11, the kitchen has been there, serving literally
              hundreds of thousands of meals to needy New Yorkers. </p>
